    "Our approach was to first define a function (format_quotes()) which reads in the quotes2.txt file, strips down the text an creates a list of full quotes in the following form Quote – Author. To address part (b) we defined the words_from_quote() which takes in a quote and splits the quote into words, compiling a list of all lowercase words in the quote.\n",
    " \n",
    "For part (c) we defined two functions. The first function (count_word_occurrence()) creates a dictionary from a quote with the keys as words in the quote and the values corresponding to the number of times the word appears in the given quote. The second function creates a posting list dictionary by calling the count word occurrence and format quotes functions. For part (d) we took a similar approach to part (c) but had to loop through each entry in the quote list to find the number of times a word appears in the dictionary. Next, we append this quote and count as a dictionary to the values and word to the keys of a new dictionary.\n",

    "For part (e) we created three separate functions. The first calculates the term frequency. The second function calculates the inverse document frequency, and the third calls the first two and multiplies their outputs together, returning the TF-IDF measure for a word and a full quote.\n",
    " \n",
    "For part (f) we wrote a function that takes in a word as an argument and calls the reverse-posting list dictionary. Next we indexed it and fed the index value to our TF-IDF function. This created our dictionary of full quotes containing the inputted word as keys and the corresponding TF-IDF measure as values. \n"
